This is an extension for Chrome

It works with old.reddit.com

You can put in a list of usersnames, and a tag for them in the format of:
username1,tag1
username2,tag2
username3,tag3
etc

When browsing old.reddit.com and one of the usernames appears, in that they make a post, they make a comment, or they are mentioned in a comment, then beside the username your specified tag for that user will appear.
Also, when you browse old.reddit.com and if a username to be tagged appears, an alert will show that indicates a username has been found on that page.
