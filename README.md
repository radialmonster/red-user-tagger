This is an extension for Chrome

It works with old.reddit.com

You can put in a list of usersnames, and a tag for them in the format of:

username1,tag1

username2,tag2

username3,tag3

etc

When browsing old.reddit.com and one of the usernames appears, in that they make a post, they make a comment, or they are mentioned in a comment, then beside the username your specified tag for that user will appear.
Also, when you browse old.reddit.com and if a username to be tagged appears, an alert will show that indicates a username has been found on that page.

You can also import a .csv file that contains 2 columns

column A is username

column B is tag

You can choose to add this import to your currenlty saved listing in the extension, or you can choose to replace your existing listing with just the imported.

You can export your saved listing to a .csv file

When the a page loads, there is a button at the bottom right that allows you to copy all the tagged users into your clipboard.  This was you can easily paste all the tagged users.
